      url: "/ai-implementation-consulting",
      description: "Deploy AI that drives results"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### Pages Requiring Additional Links:

#### High Priority (Add 3+ contextual links):
1. `/ia-dashboard` - Add to resources dropdown, footer, and blog posts
2. `/content-deduplication-dashboard` - Link from SEO-related pages
3. `/real-estate-demo` - Link from case studies and demos section
4. `/ai-voice-assistants` - Link from AI services pages
5. `/newsletter` - Add to footer and blog sidebar

#### Medium Priority (Add 2+ contextual links):
1. All blog posts - Add InternalLinkEnhancer with 3 related articles
2. `/team-expertise` - Link from about, footer, and service pages
3. `/privacy-policy` & `/terms-of-service` - Ensure footer links work

### Internal Linking Best Practices:

1. **Minimum Links per Page**: 
   - Homepage: 15-20 internal links ✅
   - Service pages: 8-12 internal links
   - Blog posts: 5-8 internal links + InternalLinkEnhancer
   - Resource pages: 10-15 internal links

2. **Anchor Text Guidelines**:
   - Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text
   - Avoid generic "click here" or "read more"
   - Match anchor text to target page's primary keyword

3. **Link Placement Strategy**:
   - Navigation: Primary pages and main services
   - Footer: Company info, services, resources, legal
   - Contextual: Related content within page body
   - Sidebar: Featured content and CTAs

4. **Link Distribution**:
   - Spread links naturally throughout content
   - Don't cluster all links in one section
   - Balance dofollow and contextual links

### Automated Link Tracking:

To identify pages needing more links, run:
```bash
node scripts/seo-audit.js
```

This will generate:
- `orphan-pages-before.csv` - Pages with 0 incoming links
- `single-link-pages-before.csv` - Pages with only 1 incoming link

### Next Steps:

1. ✅ Add InternalLinkEnhancer to all blog posts
2. ✅ Add contextual links in service pages
3. ✅ Update navigation dropdowns with newer pages
4. ✅ Ensure every page has minimum 3 internal links
5. ✅ Run link audit monthly to catch orphan pages
