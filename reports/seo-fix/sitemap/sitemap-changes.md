## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Non-Canonical/Duplicate URLs (22 total)

These URLs were removed because they are duplicates or non-canonical versions:

| Removed URL | Reason | Canonical URL |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| `/services/ai-implementation-consulting` | Duplicate route | `/ai-implementation-consulting` |
| `/resources/content-creation-agent` | Duplicate route | `/content-creation-agent` |
| `/services/digital-marketing-strategy` | Duplicate route | `/digital-marketing-strategy` |
| `/services/predictive-analytics-agent` | Duplicate route | `/predictive-analytics-agent` |
| `/technical` | Low-value legacy page | N/A |
| `/evolution` | Low-value legacy page | N/A |
| `/regulations` | Low-value legacy page | N/A |
| `/sectors` | Low-value legacy page | N/A |
| `/future` | Low-value legacy page | N/A |

**Note**: Legacy pages (technical, evolution, regulations, sectors, future) were removed from sitemap as they have minimal traffic and are being phased out. Routes still work but are not being promoted in search.

### 2. Added Missing Indexable Pages (9 total)

These pages were missing from the sitemap and have been added:

## Next Steps

1. **Submit to Google Search Console**
   ```
   https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps
   ```

2. **Verify robots.txt references sitemap**
   ```
   Sitemap: https://digitalfrontier.app/sitemap.xml
   ```

3. **Monitor indexing** for 2-4 weeks:
   - Watch for de-indexing of removed URLs
   - Confirm indexing of newly added URLs
   - Check Search Console for crawl errors

4. **Update internal links** pointing to removed URLs:
   - Search codebase for `/services/` prefix
   - Search codebase for `/resources/` prefix
   - Update to canonical URLs

---

## Validation

Run these commands to validate changes:

```bash
# Validate XML syntax
xmllint --noout public/sitemap.xml

# Check for duplicates
grep -o '<loc>.*</loc>' public/sitemap.xml | sort | uniq -d

# Count total URLs
grep -c '<url>' public/sitemap.xml

# Verify HTTPS
grep 'http://' public/sitemap.xml  # Should return nothing
```
