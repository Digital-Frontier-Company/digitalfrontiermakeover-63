## Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure Fixes (Week 1-2)
**Status: URGENT - Blocking all other SEO efforts**

### 1.1 Domain Consolidation Strategy
**Current Issue**: Split signals between thedigitalfrontier.ai and digitalfrontier.app

**Decision Required**: Choose ONE canonical domain
- **Option A**: Keep thedigitalfrontier.ai (current codebase default)
- **Option B**: Switch to digitalfrontier.app (current robots.txt target)

**Recommended**: Option A (thedigitalfrontier.ai) - less disruption, already in codebase

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Update `public/robots.txt` sitemap URL to match chosen domain
- [ ] Update `SITE_CONFIG.baseUrl` in `src/utils/seo.ts`
- [ ] Configure 301 redirects for non-canonical domain
- [ ] Update Google Search Console property
- [ ] Update all social media profile links
- [ ] Update any external citations/backlinks

### 1.2 Technical SEO Foundation
**Current State**: Good structured data, needs optimization

**Critical Fixes**:
- [ ] Ensure server-side rendering for all content (JS-only content blocking crawlers)
- [ ] Fix robots.txt domain inconsistency
- [ ] Add `llms.txt` file for AI crawler guidance
- [ ] Implement breadcrumb markup on all pages
- [ ] Add LocalBusiness schema for location targeting

### 1.3 Duplicate Content Elimination
**Targets for Consolidation**:
