    {
      question: "What's the biggest advantage of an AI-powered ad funnel?",
      answer: "The biggest advantage is personalization at scale. AI can analyze thousands of data points to deliver highly relevant experiences to each user without manual intervention, resulting in higher conversion rates and more efficient ad spend."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to implement an AI-powered ad funnel?",
      answer: "Implementation timelines vary based on complexity, but most businesses can expect a phased rollout over 2-3 months. Start with one phase of your funnel (often awareness or consideration) and expand as you collect data and refine your approach."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this approach only for large companies with big budgets?",
      answer: "Not at all. While enterprise-level AI solutions exist, there are numerous affordable tools that small businesses can utilize. Many ad platforms now include AI capabilities in their standard offerings, making this approach accessible regardless of budget size."
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI-powered retargeting differ from traditional retargeting?",
      answer: "Traditional retargeting simply shows ads to previous visitors based on pages they viewed. AI-powered retargeting predicts purchase intent, analyzes browse patterns, identifies optimal timing, personalizes messaging, and adjusts bid strategies for each user, resulting in significantly higher efficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "What metrics should I track to measure success?",
      answer: "Beyond standard metrics like CTR and conversion rate, focus on customer acquisition cost (CAC), customer lifetime value (CLV), CLV:CAC ratio, multi-touch attribution, time to conversion, and AI-specific metrics like prediction accuracy and personalization effectiveness."
