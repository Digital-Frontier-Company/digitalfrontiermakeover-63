      question: "What is the difference between AI and machine learning in marketing?",
      answer: "AI is the broader concept of machines making decisions like humans, while machine learning is a subset focused on algorithms that improve through data. In marketing, AI encompasses all intelligent technologies, while machine learning specifically powers predictive analytics, segmentation, and optimization capabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "How can marketers ensure ethical use of AI technologies?", 
      answer: "Marketers can ensure ethical AI use by implementing robust data governance, practicing transparency about AI usage, conducting regular bias audits, maintaining human oversight of AI systems, respecting privacy preferences, and creating clear ethical guidelines for all AI marketing initiatives."
    },
    {
      question: "What technical skills should marketers develop to work effectively with AI?",
      answer: "While marketers don't need to become data scientists, they should develop basic data literacy, understand how AI systems make decisions, learn to interpret AI insights, know the limitations of AI tools, and cultivate the ability to collaborate effectively with technical teams implementing AI solutions."

        <p className="text-slate-300">
          AI analyzes big data (customer history, behavior) for insights like churn prediction. 
          Uses machine learning models (regression, neural networks). Ethical risk: Biased input 
          data leads to biased predictions. Need representative data.

        <p className="text-slate-300">
          AI creates micro-segments, even of one. Recommendation engines analyze behavior to tailor 
          content/products. Uses clustering, collaborative filtering. Ethical risk: Balancing relevance 
          vs. intrusion; avoiding sensitive attributes without consent.

        <p className="text-slate-300">
          AI creates text, images, video (e.g., GPT-4, DALL-E). Turbocharges content production. 
          Ethical risks: Misinformation ("hallucinations"), authenticity, biased outputs, lack of 
          transparency (should AI content be disclosed?). Requires human oversight.
